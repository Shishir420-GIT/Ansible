# Meta module in ansible

In Ansible, the meta module is used to control certain aspects of playbook execution, manage play states, and handle playbook flow. It allows you to perform actions that affect the execution environment and how tasks are run without necessarily being tied to a specific resource. Below are some common uses and commands associated with the meta module:

## Common meta Commands
1. flush_handlers

Description: Executes any handlers that have been notified up to the point of invocation.
Use Case: When you want to force the handlers to run before continuing with other tasks in the playbook.
Example:
```
- name: Flush Handlers
  meta: flush_handlers
```

2. end_play

Description: Ends the current play immediately.
Use Case: To stop the play when a certain condition is met or to skip to the next play.
Example:
```
- name: End the current play if condition met
  meta: end_play
```

3. clear_facts

Description: Clears all facts gathered for the current host.
Use Case: When you want to remove facts to ensure that subsequent tasks do not rely on old or incorrect data.
Example:
```
- name: Clear facts
  meta: clear_facts
```

4. set_stats

Description: Sets playbook statistics for the playbook run, which can be accessed later.
Use Case: To store specific statistics that you want to reference later in the playbook.
Example:
```
- name: Set custom statistics
  meta:
    set_stats:
      custom_key: "custom_value"
```

5. include_role or import_role with meta

Description: Allows you to include or import roles dynamically in your playbooks.
Use Case: When you want to execute a role based on certain conditions or variables.
Example:
```
- name: Include role based on a condition
  meta: include_role
    name: my_role
```

### Example:
```meta_implementation.yaml ``` is a more comprehensive example showcasing the use of meta commands:

### Summary
- The meta module provides a way to control playbook execution and manage play states effectively.
- It can be used to flush handlers, end plays, clear facts, set statistics, and include roles.
- ```meta``` commands allow for greater flexibility and control in playbook execution, making it easier to manage complex workflows and ensure the playbook runs as intended.
- Using the meta module effectively can help streamline your Ansible playbooks and enhance their functionality.
