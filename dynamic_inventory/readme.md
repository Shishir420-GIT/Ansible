# Using or Creating a dynamic inventory

The add_host module in Ansible is used to dynamically add a host to the inventory during a playbook run. This is useful when you need to interact with hosts that arenâ€™t initially in your inventory file or when you want to group hosts dynamically based on certain conditions during a playbook run.

Basic Syntax of add_host
```
- name: Add a host to inventory
  add_host:
    name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"  # The name or IP of the host to add
    groups: "dynamic_group"           # The group to add this host to
    ansible_user: "new_user"          # Optional: define variables for the new host
```

## Example 1:  Playbook Using add_host
This playbook demonstrates:
- Adding a host dynamically.
- Running tasks on that newly added host in a separate play.

## Explanation of How add_host Works
- Add a Host to Inventory:
- - The add_host module is executed on the localhost machine (or wherever the play is running).
- - This adds the specified host (e.g., 192.168.1.100) to the group dynamic_group in the in-memory inventory.

- Define Variables for the New Host:
- - You can specify variables such as ansible_user, ansible_port, etc., directly within add_host.
- - These variables are applied only to the newly added host.

- Run Tasks on the New Host:
- - In the second play, the hosts directive is set to dynamic_group, so Ansible now treats 192.168.1.100 as part of the inventory.
- - This play will target and run tasks on the newly added host.

- When to Use add_host
- - Dynamic Host Addition:
- - - If you dynamically obtain IP addresses or hostnames during the playbook execution. You can use add_host to add these hosts to your inventory and interact with them immediately.

- - Dynamic Group Creation:
- - - If you want to create groups of hosts on the fly (e.g., only add web servers with specific configurations), add_host is ideal for that

- - Conditional Inclusion:
- - - Use add_host to include or exclude hosts from specific tasks or plays based on conditions.
